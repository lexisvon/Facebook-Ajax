Build the comments section of the Facebook page you built using the same approach as this drill.

Delete all of the comments from the HTML
Create JSON to represent all of the comments (You should already have this, since it was homework on Wednesday night)
Write JavaScript that fetches all the comments and adds them to the DOM when the Facebook page loads
